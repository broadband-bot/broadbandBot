Tribal lands shown on the nationwide map include:\n\nAny federally recognized Indian tribe’s reservation, pueblo, or colony,\nFormer reservations in Oklahoma,\nAlaska Native regions established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (view maps: 2010 U.S. Census American Indians and Alaska Natives Map – Alaska, State of Alaska ANCSA Boundaries Map),\nIndian allotments,\nHawaiian Home Lands (view map: 2010 U.S. Census Hawaiian Homelands), and\nAny land approved as Tribal for the purposes of the Lifeline program or the ACP by the FCC’s Office of Native Affairs and Policy and Wireline Competition Bureau.\n\nFor additional file formats, visit Lifeline’s Tribal Lands page.\n\nTips for Applicants\nRemember to click the ‘Confirm Tribal Qualification’ button on the online application.\nOn the paper application, check the ‘Tribal Lands’ box.\nProve your identity by providing the last four digits of your Social Security Number, your Tribal ID, or identity documents.
